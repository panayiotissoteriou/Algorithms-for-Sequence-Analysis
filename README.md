Bioinformatics and Systems Biology MSc - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam / University of Amsterdam

Dynamic Programming assignment:
Coded the Needlman-Wunsch, Waterman-Eggert, and Smith-Waterman algorithms for global, semi-global and local sequence alignments.

Hidden Markov model assignment:
Training a hidden Markov model to recognise domain and linker regions in protein sequences, using a 3-letter amino acid alphabet: H - hydrophobic, P - polar and C - charged. Coded and implemented the forward, backward and Baum-Welch algorithms, given a sequence(s), an Emission matrix and a Transition probabilities.

Sequence Generator assignment:
Implementing a function that generates a random sequence using the choice() function, given a Transition and an Emission matrix.
